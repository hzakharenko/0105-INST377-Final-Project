## About this Project
This project uses the [UMD.io](https://umd.io/), an API with the University of Maryland designed by students, for students. The project displays a couple of bar charts using Charts.js. It also uses the built-in Fetch API to make HTTP requests to the API and use localStorage. There is one chart that can be filtered through user input and two static charts as well. There is no particular CSS framework used, but I did use Flexbox to create my layout. The project is trying to display all of the majors/course codes at UMD and the number of course offerings they have. It is solving the problem where students don't know what major they would have the most freedom to choose in. There is a chart that lets users filter if they want to learn about a particular major or they can see the 10 majors with the most course offerings and the 10 majors with the least course offerings.
